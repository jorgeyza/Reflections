When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I know I'll be working on different computers or to collaborate with other
people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there might be commits that are ready or that maybe I didn't intend to make public in the first time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copies that are made inside the GitHub workspace. They are referenced to the origanl owner, but you can modify then as you want. Clones are copies made from GitHub to your local machine or from one part of your local machine to another part. Branches are like another path that a main line of coding or making of a project have taken. They can be later merged into the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that I can know act accordingly with that information. I'll be sure that I'm going through the right path or if I just missed something.
